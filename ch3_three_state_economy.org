#+TITLE: Chapter 3: Three-State Economy

This chapter enriches the two-state economy by just a single additional state while keeping the number of traded financial assets constant at 2.
In this slightly enriched /static three-state economy/, the notions of market incompleteness and indeterminancy of the martingale measure are discussed.
Super-replication and approximate replication approaches are presented to cope with incompleteness and its consequences for the pricing of contingent claims.
This chapter also presents the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which builds on the mean-variance portfolio analysis and adds equilibrium arguments to derive prices for financial assets in mean-volatility space even if they are not replicable.
